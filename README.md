# FilteringAndPaging
 A sample of filtering and paging with a decent dataset

Build and run this project on a Windows system. On startup, the project will create a new database on MSSQL LocalDB named FilteringAndPagingSample and poplate it with 150,000 records. Each time the project is reloaded, the database is cleared and re-initialized.

Once the project is loaded, you can create some batches that filter on string (UserName) or int (EmployeeId) from the homepage.
